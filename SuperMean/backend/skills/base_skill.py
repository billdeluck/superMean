# Directory: backend/skills/
# File: base_skill.py
# Description: Base definitions or utilities for skills (currently empty).

"""
This file can contain:
- Base classes if skills need to share complex setup/teardown logic.
- Common utility functions used by multiple skills.
- Shared constants or enums related to skills.

Currently, the core registration and calling logic is in `backend/skills/__init__.py`.
Individual skills are implemented as decorated functions in separate files within this directory.

# Example of a potential utility function:
# def validate_skill_input(data: dict, schema: dict) -> bool:
#     # Implementation using jsonschema or pydantic
#     pass

pass # No base functionality needed yet
