## Feature Implementation Tracker
| Feature | Version | Status | Owner | Target Release |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Multi-agent orchestration | 1.3.0 | 15% | Core Team | Q4 2024 | Roadmap v2
| Dynamic skill loading | 1.2.1 | 40% | DevOps | Q3 2024 | Roadmap v1
| Automated evaluation loops | 1.4.0 | 5% | Research Team | Q1 2025 | Roadmap v3

## Known Limitations
1. ~~Concurrent agent execution limited to 5 parallel processes~~ (Scheduled: Q4 2024)
2. Model routing lacks fallback mechanisms (In Progress)
3. Memory system only supports English content (Planned: Q2 2025)

## Recommended Features
| Priority | Feature | Complexity | Estimated Value |
|----------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| P0 | Fault-tolerant model routing | High | Critical |
| P1 | Multilingual memory support | Medium | High |
| P2 | Agent performance dashboard | Low | Medium |

## Pending Features
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Dynamic skill loading
- Automated evaluation loops
