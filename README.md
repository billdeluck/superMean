System Vision and Goals
Vision
To create an advanced, modular AI Agent ecosystem that autonomously builds domain-specific solutions through SuperAgents and specialized sub-agents, leveraging a comprehensive skill library and dynamic model connections.

Primary Goals
Self-Improvement: Create agents that can analyze their own performance and implement improvements
Domain Specialization: Build agents capable of solving problems specific to industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance
Memory Integration: Implement persistent memory to prevent redundant tasks and enable continuous learning
Modularity: Develop a flexible architecture where components can be added, modified, or replaced without disrupting the entire system
Model Agnosticism: Support multiple AI models (Gemini, DeepSeek, RouterAPI) with fallback mechanisms
